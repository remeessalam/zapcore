            1. The Digital-First Consumer Mindset
          </h2>
          <p class="mb-6">
            In 2024, more than ever, consumers are turning to digital platforms
            to research products and services before making decisions. Whether
            they’re searching for reviews, comparing prices, or exploring
            options, your online presence is often their first impression of
            your business. A strong digital presence ensures you’re visible,
            credible, and accessible when potential customers are looking for
            solutions you provide.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-6">
            <span class="font-semibold">Key Insight:</span> Businesses with
            optimized websites, active social media profiles, and engaging

            platforms where your target audience spends their time is vital to
            standing out.
